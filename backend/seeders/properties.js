In collaboration with Galantus, the landscape was meticulously designed to complement and enhance the architecture. From the street, the house remains nearly invisible, tucked behind a grassy embankment, while on the canal side, expansive windows and a rustic facade create a striking contrast. The design gradually reveals itself, beginning with a wild meadow garden where narrow, trimmed paths echo the organic flow of the architecture. As the building extends deeper into the property, its form evolves - what starts as a grounded volume rises into a more geometric composition, with the master bedroom appearing to float above the terrain in a futuristic, hovering design.",

The transformation of the architectural space relies entirely on the relationship with the trees—neither encroaching upon them nor isolating them. There are three strategies. First, the scattered buildings were integrated into three courtyards, each relatively independent yet closely connected. Second, the boundaries between the built environment and the natural surroundings were blurred, allowing trees to coexist within the courtyards and the courtyards to extend into the trees, creating a seamless interaction between architecture and nature. Finally, new functions were infused based on the distinct characteristics of each space, creating a bridge of experience between the \"artificial\" and the \"natural\".",

Villa Almerico —designed by Andrea Palladio and inspired by Alberti's treatise De re aedificatoria— exemplifies this evolution. Renowned for its centralized and symmetrical plan, its construction marked a turning point with classical proportions and the incorporation of courtyards and gardens as extensions of the living space, highlighting a remarkable contextual relationship.",
